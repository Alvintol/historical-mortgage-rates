Historical values for posted rates as far back as 1973 but we only go as far back as 2006 to 2022. These rates are sourced from the Bank of Canada which sources its data from posted bank rates.
All data is collected from discounted 5-year variable mortgage rates from Ratehub.ca proprietary data sets as well as discount mortgage brokers.

Data is seperated per year and per month and exported into a csv file.
